# AI-Introductory-Telco-Churn-EDA
Beginner-friendly EDA project using the Telco Churn dataset.  This project is part of my AI Foundation Level portfolio.
# 📊 Telco Churn EDA (Beginner Project)

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset.  
The goal is to understand customer behavior and identify patterns related to churn using only foundational Python tools.

##  Project Overview
- Loaded and explored the dataset structure  
- Cleaned missing/incorrect values  
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric  
- Performed **univariate analysis** (histograms, countplots)  
- Performed **bivariate analysis** (boxplots, cross-tabs, comparisons)  
- Visualized trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Created a simple **correlation heatmap** for numerical features  

## Libraries used are:
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

##  Key Insights (Beginner Level)
- Customers with **short tenure** tend to churn more  
- **Month-to-month** contract users have the highest churn  
- Higher **MonthlyCharges** are associated with higher churn  
- **Electronic Check** payment method shows higher churn rates  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is part of my **AI Introductory** learning path, focusing on understanding and visualizing data before going into machine learning models.  
More beginner EDA projects will be added as I revisit my course content.
